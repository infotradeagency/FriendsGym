# Images Folder

This folder is for storing your gym's images.

## Current Setup

The website currently uses high-quality placeholder images from Unsplash. These work perfectly fine and are completely free to use.

## If you want to use your own images:

1. Take high-quality photos of your gym:
   - Gym equipment and facilities
   - Training sessions
   - Before/after transformations
   - Trainers and staff
   - Happy members

2. Place your images in this folder (assets/images/)

3. Update the image URLs in index.html:
   - Replace `https://images.unsplash.com/...` URLs
   - With `assets/images/your-image-name.jpg`

## Recommended Image Sizes:

- **Hero Background**: 1920x1080px (landscape)
- **About Section**: 800x1000px (portrait)
- **Program Cards**: 600x400px (landscape)
- **General Photos**: 1200x800px (landscape)

## Image Format:
- Use JPG for photos (better compression)
- Use PNG for logos or graphics with transparency
- Optimize images before uploading (use tools like TinyPNG.com)

## Note:
The current Unsplash images are perfectly fine for a professional website and are being used by many businesses worldwide. You can keep them or replace them with your own photos anytime.
